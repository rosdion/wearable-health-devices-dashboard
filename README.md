# 📊 Wearable Health Devices Dashboard – Tableau Project

This project uses Tableau to analyze and visualize popular wearable health devices by:

- 💰 Price
- 🔋 Battery Life
- 💧 Water Resistance
- 🧭 Features (Heart Rate Monitor, GPS, Sleep Tracking)

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Apple leads in features, but at premium pricing.
- Fitbit and Huawei offer strong value under $10K.
- WHOOP lacks water resistance — a tradeoff for active users.

## 📦 Files
- `Wearable_Devices_Dashboard.twbx` – Tableau dashboard
- `/screenshots/` – Image exports of key charts
- `summary.pdf` – 1-page insight summary (optional)

## 📊 Tools
- Tableau Public

## 📎 Business Questions
- What brand offers the best value under $10K?
- Which device has the best feature-to-price ratio?
- Which devices are waterproof, accurate, and affordable?
